# OmniLightVision

## Overview

OmniLightVision is an image recognition project utilizing YOLOv8, designed to identify traffic signals using a custom dataset. The project enhances road safety by providing real-time detection of traffic lights, enabling intelligent decision-making for autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems.

## Key Features

- **Roboflow Dataset Integration:** Utilizes the Roboflow platform to download and preprocess the traffic light dataset seamlessly.
  
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8:** Employs the YOLOv8 architecture from Ultralytics for robust object detection and recognition.

- **Custom Dataset Training:** Trains the YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset, ensuring high accuracy and adaptability across diverse scenarios.

- **Real-time Inference:** Performs real-time inference on images or video streams to detect traffic lights in various environments.

## Project Structure

- **`Traffic_Light_Detection.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook containing the main project code, including dataset downloading, transfer learning evaluation, and visualization.

- **`README.md`:** This file, providing an overview of the project, its features, project structure, and usage instructions.
